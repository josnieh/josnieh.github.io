                            <p> I learned that the movement and interaction of a website/app is a crucial part of design. It really enhances and creates the user experience. I realized how intentionally websites/apps are builts with the end user in mind. </p>

                            <p> I really enjoyed the live video/GIFs throughout the article. Though there were no reads, I felt that I was able to understand the message behind this articles which I think it similar to what design is meant to do.  </p>

                            <p> I really liked the easygrow interface. I really liked how they invluded pictures of each plant and there was a notebook section with various trackers.The buttom at the top that kept track of how many of each plant the user has is also very helpful.  </p>
